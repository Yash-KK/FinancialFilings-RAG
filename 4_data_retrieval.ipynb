Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\\n\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $14 million for Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\n\\n## Technology and Infrastructure\\n\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\n\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The decrease in technology and infrastructure costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, partially offset by an increase in spending on infrastructure. See Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.\\n\\n## Sales and Marketing\\n\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\\n\\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and decreased advertising expenses.\\n\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\n\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.\\n\\n\"),\n",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n## (unaudited)\\n\\n## Note 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\n\\n## Unaudited Interim Financial Information\\n\\nWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Prior Period Reclassifications\\n\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 'Other assets' were reclassified out of 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\n\\n## Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\\n\\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q1 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $897 million and a benefit to net income of $695 million, or $0.07 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share.\\n\\n\"),\n",

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\\n\\nInterest expense was $823 million and $644 million during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 3 - Leases and Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.\\n\\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net was $(443) million and $(2.7) billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(467) million and $(2.0) billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, from our equity investment in Rivian.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\nOur income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948 million, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.5 billion, which included $558 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 7 - Income Taxes' for additional information.\\n\\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\\n\\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.\\n\\n## Free Cash Flow\\n\\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.' The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):\\n\\n|                                                                                | Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2023 2024   | Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2023 2024   |\\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\\n|                                                                                | 2023                                      | 2024                                      |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                            | $ 54,330                                  | $ 99,147                                  |\\n| Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives | (57,649)                                  | (48,998)                                  |\\n| Free cash flow                                                                 | $ (3,319)                                 | $ 50,149                                  |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                            | $ (54,313)                                | $ (51,889)                                |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                            | $ 14,082                                  | $ (23,489)                                |\\n\\n\"),\n",

We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $60.6 billion and $59.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.\\n\\nWe have a $352 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we decreased from $1.5 billion to $352 million in March 2024 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the 'Credit Facility'). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $682 million and $352 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, which had an interest rate of 6.6%. We reclassified all of the $352 million outstanding as of March 31, 2024 to be included with the current portion of longterm debt within 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, we have pledged $806 million and $466 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nIn January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Term Loan'), maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. The Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the entire amount of the Term Loan had been repaid.\\n\\nWe have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the 'Commercial Paper Programs') under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.\\n\\nWe have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Credit Agreement'), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nWe have a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Short-Term Credit Agreement'), which matures in October 2024 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nWe also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $147 million and $50 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, which were included in 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $8.5 billion of unused letters of credit as of March 31, 2024.\\n\\n## Note 6 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\\n\\n## Stock Repurchase Activity\\n\\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.\\n\\n## Stock Award Plans\\n\\nEmployees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years. The majority of restricted stock unit awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 as part of the annual compensation review and primarily vest semi-annually in Q2 and Q4 of the relevant compensation year.\\n\\n\"),\n",

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\\n\\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $31.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $6.7 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.0 billion and $0.6 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\n## Digital Video and Music Content\\n\\nThe total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 were $17.4 billion and $17.9 billion. Total video and music expense was $4.0 billion and $4.6 billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\n## Unearned Revenue\\n\\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.9 billion, of which $6.1 billion was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Included in 'Other long-term liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets was $5.7 billion and $6.4 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $157.7 billion as of March 31, 2024. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.1 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\\n\\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures.\\n\\n\"),\n",

We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian's board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\n\"),\n",

Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $12.8 billion and $338 million for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $6.4 billion and $1.6 billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $8 million and $42 million during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs, and we had $352 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.\\n\\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\\n\\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $619 million and $458 million for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $480 million. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies' and 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\n\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\n\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\\n\\n\"),\n",

In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\\n\\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\n\\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\n\\n|                             | Three Months Ended March 31,   | Three Months Ended March 31,   | Twelve Months Ended March 31,   | Twelve Months Ended March 31,   |\\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\\n|                             | 2023                           | 2024                           | 2023                            | 2024                            |\\n| Cash provided by (used in): |                                |                                |                                 |                                 |\\n| Operating activities        | $ 4,788                        | $ 18,989                       | $ 54,330                        | $ 99,147                        |\\n| Investing activities        | (15,806)                       | (17,862)                       | (54,313)                        | (51,889)                        |\\n| Financing activities        | 6,354                          | (1,256)                        | 14,082                          | (23,489)                        |\\n\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $86.8 billion and $85.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.\\n\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $4.8 billion and $19.0 billion for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\n\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(15.8) billion and $(17.9) billion for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $13.1 billion and $13.9 billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to meaningfully increase in 2024, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. We funded the acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\\n\\n')]"

Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\\n\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $14 million for Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\n\\n## Technology and Infrastructure\\n\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\n\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The decrease in technology and infrastructure costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, partially offset by an increase in spending on infrastructure. See Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.\\n\\n## Sales and Marketing\\n\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\\n\\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and decreased advertising expenses.\\n\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\n\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.\\n\\n\"),\n",

Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $12.8 billion and $338 million for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $6.4 billion and $1.6 billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $8 million and $42 million during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs, and we had $352 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.\\n\\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\\n\\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $619 million and $458 million for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $480 million. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies' and 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\n\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\n\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\\n\\n\"),\n",

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\\n\\nInterest expense was $823 million and $644 million during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.

The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(467) million and $(2.0) billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, from our equity investment in Rivian.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\nOur income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948 million, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.5 billion, which included $558 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 7 - Income Taxes' for additional information.\\n\\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\\n\\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.\\n\\n## Free Cash Flow\\n\\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.'

In addition, changes in fuel, utility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q2 2024.\\n\\n## Net Sales\\n\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\\n\\n|                                                                                   | Three Months Ended March 31,   | Three Months Ended March 31,   |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\\n|                                                                                   | 2023                           | 2024                           |\\n| Net Sales:                                                                        |                                |                                |\\n| North America                                                                     | $ 76,881                       | $ 86,341                       |\\n| International                                                                     | 29,123                         | 31,935                         |\\n| AWS                                                                               | 21,354                         | 25,037                         |\\n| Consolidated                                                                      | $ 127,358                      | $ 143,313                      |\\n| Year-over-year Percentage Growth:                                                 |                                |                                |\\n| North America                                                                     | 11 %                           | 12 %                           |\\n| International                                                                     |                                | 10                             |\\n| AWS                                                                               | 16                             | 17                             |\\n| Consolidated                                                                      | 9                              | 13                             |\\n| Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: |                                |                                |\\n| North America                                                                     | 11 %                           | 12 %                           |\\n| International                                                                     | 9                              | 11                             |\\n| AWS                                                                               | 16                             | 17                             |\\n| Consolidated                                                                      | 11                             | 13                             |\\n| Net Sales Mix:                                                                    |                                |                                |\\n| North America                                                                     | 60 %                           | 60 %                           |\\n| International                                                                     | 23                             | 22                             |\\n| AWS                                                                               | 17                             | 18                             |\\n| Consolidated                                                                      | 100 %                          | 100 %                          |\\n\\nSales increased 13% in Q1 2024 compared to the comparable prior year period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n## (unaudited)\\n\\n## Note 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\n\\n## Unaudited Interim Financial Information\\n\\nWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Prior Period Reclassifications\\n\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 'Other assets' were reclassified out of 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\n\\n## Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\\n\\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q1 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $897 million and a benefit to net income of $695 million, or $0.07 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share.\\n\\n\"),\n",
